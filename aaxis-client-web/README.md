# Aaxis Test App
- Angular 12
- Angular Material
- Angular Flex Layout
- Email/Password authentication
- Auth Session Management
- Core Module/Feature Module/Shared

## Credits to the author of the base project.

For the development of the application, the Angular Starter project (https://github.com/nitin7dc/angular-starter.git) was used as a basis for the implementation of the authentication management system.
The corresponding adjustments were made, and thus have an adequate base project to implement the views requested in the Aaxis test.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
